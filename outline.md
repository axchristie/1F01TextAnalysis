# Dataviz 2 Outline

## Next steps to cover in lecture

Walk through several examples of generating visualizations and demonstrating basic findings.

## Things to add for the prototype

Nothing added this week. We will test your tool with a set text and terms, which are provided in advance. If we get the correct output, you get full points.

The point of this week is to ensure to fundamentals are in place so students have the functional code necessary to complete their dataviz assigments.
